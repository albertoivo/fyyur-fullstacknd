The README says that 'templates/forms pages are complete, but:

    - 'new_artist.html' doesn't have the properties: 'seeking_venue', 'seeking_description' and 'website'.
       And the page 'show_artist.html' use them.

    - 'new_venue.html'. It doesn't have properties: 'seeking_venue', 'seeking_description' and 'website'.
       And the page 'show_venue.html' use them.

So I had to modify the 'templates/forms/new_artist.html' and 'templates/forms/new_venue.html', ok?
